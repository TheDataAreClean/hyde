<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my new microblog. A fancy way of saying this is a place where I write down my feelings that are may be a tad bit too touchy to hamper my employment opportunities. Then again, if a prospect employer is hurt by any of the content here, maybe I shouldn’t be working with them. <code>&lt;&lt; makes mental note &gt;&gt;</code></p>
<p>But coming back to the topic at hand, welcome to the microblog! This place is like a personal (hopefully not too personal) account of things I feel strongly about. It could be anything under the sun. Or the moon! Or the sky? You get the point. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>If you’d like to know more about me, you can go <a href="https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/">here</a> and you can follow my work <a href="https://thedataareclean.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you around!</p>
