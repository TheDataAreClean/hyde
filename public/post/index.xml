      <description>Are there days you just don’t identify with yourself? This person that you have become. The likes and dislikes you tell yourself and the world, your interests and your habits.

Then again, if a prospect employer is hurt by any of the content here, maybe I shouldn’t be working with them. &amp;lt;&amp;lt; makes mental note &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
But coming back to the topic at hand, welcome to the microblog!</description>
