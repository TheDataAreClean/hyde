Hello everyone, welcome to my new microblog. A fancy way of saying this is a place where I write down my feelings that are may be a tad bit too touchy to hamper my employment opportunities. Then again, if a prospect employer is hurt by any of the content here, maybe I shouldn't be working with them. ` << makes mental note >> `


But coming back to the topic at hand, welcome to the microblog! This place is like a personal (hopefully not too personal) account of things I feel strongly about. It could be anything under the sun. Or the moon! Or the sky? You get the point. I hope you enjoy it!

If you'd like to know more about me, you can go [here](https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/) and you can follow my work [here](https://thedataareclean.com/).

Hope to see you around! 

`Tata !`
