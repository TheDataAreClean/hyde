<p>Are there days you just donâ€™t identify with yourself? This person that you have become. The likes and dislikes you tell yourself and the world, your interests and your habits. Every last detail about you. None of it feels like you, it feels like a version of you that you adopted because it was the most convenient one. Or worse, capitalism convinced you that you are this person even though you end some days feeling disconnected with every part of or you.</p>
