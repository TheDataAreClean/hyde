  A new tool is spotted in the wild ! I love productivity tools. Correction, I am obsessed with productivity tools. To-Dos, Notes, Planners, all kinds. If there is a tool that was released, I have probably tried it, trying it right now and saving up time and money to do it soon. It’s a problem, I am working on it. &lt;–

But coming back to the topic at hand, welcome to the microblog!
